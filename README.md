# 2DPlatformerGame

This is a small Indie game that covers all aspects of creating a complete platformer game in Godot game engine including:

- Game mechanics like player movement, collectibles, and basic combat
- Hazards like spikes and enemies
- A seamless game loop and transitions between levels
- Scene structure and project organization
- Sound effects
- A main menu, pause menu, options menu, and other UI elements
- Finishing touches like camera shake, basic shaders, particle effects, and UI animations

What I learned:

- 2D platformer mechanics - double jumping, dashing, collectables, and enemies
- Polish & Game Feel - particles, camera shake, scene transitions, and sound effects
- UI - main menu, pause menu, options menu, and other elements
- Publishing - exporting the project executable, updating the executable icon, and changing the boot splash
- Godot Engine Concepts - leveraging a variety of nodes, structuring scenes, signals, and more
